Project: Creating a Neural Network for Digit Recognition on a Grid.

This project draws inspiration from deep learning and utilizes mathematical optimization techniques to find the best parameters for the network. 
It is developed in the C programming language, and the required functions to enhance the neural network are available in the "brain.h" library.
